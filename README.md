## Retail Inventory Management

### How it Works: 
This system predicts inventory requirements based on historical sales data, seasonal trends, and market dynamics. It helps retailers maintain optimal stock levels, reducing both overstock and stockouts.

### Execution Strategy: 
Implement data collection from point-of-sale systems, use time series forecasting models, and develop user-friendly dashboards for inventory management. Collaboration with retailers for pilot testing and feedback is crucial.
